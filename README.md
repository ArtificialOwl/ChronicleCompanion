# ChronicleCompanion

A World of Warcraft addon that replaces combat logging with enriched unit metadata for use with [Chronicle](https://github.com/Emyrk/chronicle).

Upload your enriched combat logs at [chronicleclassic.com](https://chronicleclassic.com).

## Features

- **Extended Unit Tracking** — Automatically logs unit GUIDs, names, levels, owners (for pets/minions), and buff information to your combat log
- **Challenge Mode Detection** — Detects and logs player challenge modes (Hardcore, Level One Lunatic, Exhaustion, etc.)

## Requirements

- [SuperWoW](https://github.com/balakethelock/SuperWoW)
- [Nampower](https://gitea.com/avitasia/nampower)

You can still use [SuperWoWCombatLogger](https://github.com/pepopo978/SuperWowCombatLogger) for Turtlogs compatibility.
